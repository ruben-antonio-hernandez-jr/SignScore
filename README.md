---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO RUN A PRE-TRAINED MODEL (AFTER ENSURING THAT YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED THE "action.h5" MODEL)
FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW:
    # import necessary basic libraries (STEP 1)
    # establish holistic and drawing mediapipe variables (STEP 2)
    # run required functions (STEPS 3 - 6)
    # import tensorflow and keras packages (STEP 7)
    # establish model variable (STEP 8)
    # load pre-trained model (STEP 9)
    # import scipy stats (STEP 10)
    # run real-time testing (STEP 11)

THESE STEPS ARE ALSO WRITTEN IN THE PYTHON FILE AND EACH STEP IS MARKED WITH THE STEP #
